We are conducting an academic study about the usefulness of webcam-based eye-tracking when working on micro-tasks. Should you accept this task, you will complete a set of image classification tasks using either your keyboard or your eyes (with a webcam). We only collect information about timing and accuracy, and webcam data will NOT be sent over the internet.

Requirements for this task:

- This task can be completed on a desktop computer only
- You must have a webcam
- The room should be bright enough that your eyes are reasonably visible 

By finishing this task, you agree that the collected information will be used in an academic study performed by the Delft University of Technology.

Make sure to leave this window open as you complete the survey. When you are finished, you will return to this page to paste the code into the box.
